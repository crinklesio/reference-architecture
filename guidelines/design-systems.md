## Components
Every system has these generic components that you see coming back. Buttons, input fields, tables, you name it. These components are called *foundational* components. Foundational components exist in four different categories.

* **Form**: input, buttons, checkboxes.
* **Navigation**: link, tabs, breadcrumbs, pagination.
* **Structure**: footer, accordion, table.
* **Utilities**: toast, dialog, tooltip.

Next to foundational components you have *application* components. These are non-generic components. They are often a combination of foundational components, or deviate from the foundational rules. No pre-defined categories exist for these components, but you can make them based on common sense.
